CM Scout Sources
================
I offer no support at all on the source code for this program, if your just interested in using the program, then go to http://www.nygreen.net and download a compiled version. I've released the sources so others might learn something, and start writing their own editors for Championship Manager.

The code might be messy at times and a bit difficult to follow, especially because I don't use many comments. I apologies for this, but that's the way I often program things like this.

If you find any bugs in the code, then please visit the http://www.nygreen.net and make a post in the forum informing me of this.

You will need to install a couple of components, to be able to compile this program:
