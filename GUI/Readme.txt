======================================================================

This newest version of CM Scout is developed for Championship Manager
4. The program will make it possible for you to find just the right
player for your team, by giving you the option to filter the players
by almost all possible attributes, both those visible and those hidden
in the game. This program will help you scout for the right players,
whether you are managing Real Madrid and on the lookout for the next
big international star, or some small team in one of the lower
leagues, looking for some cheap quality players that can improve your
team in your quest for promotion. When you have found a list of
players which fits your profile, you can export them to a shortlist
file, which can be opened in the game and make it easy for you to
submit offers for the right players.

Besides helping you in scouting for new players to improve your team,
the program is also very helpful in deciding which of your current
players are good enough to actually be a part of your team. This can
be done by quickly listing all players in your team, or just the
players in one of your squads. This feature of the program can also be
used to scout your next opponent, to figure out if they have any good
players which you'll have to watch out for.
